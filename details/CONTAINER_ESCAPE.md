# CONTAINER_ESCAPE Bypass Technique

## Overview

CONTAINER_ESCAPE is a bypass technique that exploits vulnerabilities in containerized web applications to escape the confines of their isolated environment and gain access to the underlying host system or other containers. This often involves leveraging vulnerabilities in the container runtime, orchestration platform, or the application itself to achieve privilege escalation or lateral movement.  This is distinct from simply exploiting a vulnerability *within* the container; this technique focuses on breaking out *of* the container.


## Technical Details

- **Method**:  Exploitation of container vulnerabilities, potentially combined with other attack vectors (e.g.,  privilege escalation within the container before escaping).
- **Vulnerability**:  Vulnerabilities in the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd, rkt), orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm), or misconfigurations allowing privilege escalation or access to host resources. This could involve vulnerabilities in the container's image, kernel exploits, or flaws in the container's networking or security policies.
- **Impact**:  Complete compromise of the host system, access to other containers, data breaches, denial-of-service, and potential for further attacks on other systems within the network.
- **Common Targets**: Containerized web applications deployed on platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or using other container runtimes.  Applications with insufficiently secured container images or those running with excessive privileges are particularly vulnerable.


## Example

Let's imagine a scenario where a vulnerable containerized web application (running as user "appuser") contains a flaw allowing local privilege escalation to "root" within the container.  A successful exploit could then leverage vulnerabilities in the container runtime (e.g., a known CVE affecting the Docker daemon) to escape the container and execute commands as "root" on the host machine.  This might involve exploiting a misconfiguration that allows privileged containers to access host system files or devices.


## How to Test

Testing for CONTAINER_ESCAPE requires sophisticated knowledge of container technology and potential vulnerabilities.  Simple curl commands won't suffice.  Ethical testing should only be performed with explicit permission.

### Using curl
Not applicable directly for this technique.  Curl is used for interacting with the web application *inside* the container, not for escaping the container itself.

### Using Burp Suite
Burp Suite is not directly used to escape a container. However, Burp Suite can assist in identifying vulnerabilities *within* the containerized application that could then be leveraged as a stepping stone towards container escape. The focus would be on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities that lead to privilege escalation within the container before attempting the escape.

### Manual Testing
Manual testing requires advanced skills in Linux system administration, container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes etc.), and exploit development.  It involves analyzing the container image, its runtime environment, and searching for known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that could be exploited to achieve privilege escalation and subsequently escape.


## Security Implications

- **Security Controls Bypassed:** Container security features (e.g., seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux), network isolation, resource limits, and access control policies.
- **Potential Risks and Impacts:** Total compromise of the host system, data loss, disruption of services, lateral movement to other systems, and potential for ransomware or other malicious activity.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios:** An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability in a container image to gain root access within the container. Then, they could use that access to exploit a vulnerability in the Docker daemon or the host system to escape the container and gain control of the underlying infrastructure.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect this bypass attempt:**  Regular security audits, vulnerability scanning of container images, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) configured to detect suspicious activity related to container escape attempts.  Monitoring system logs for unusual processes or activity related to the container runtime.
- **Mitigation strategies:**  Employ least privilege principle for containers, use up-to-date and hardened container images, implement strong access control policies, utilize container security tools (e.g., AppArmor, SELinux), employ runtime security scanners, and regularly patch the host operating system and container runtime.  Regular security audits of container deployments are crucial.
- **Secure coding practices:**  Follow secure coding practices when developing applications destined for containerization.  Avoid hardcoding sensitive information and minimize the application's privileges.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** WAFs are not directly effective against container escape.  However, a robust WAF can prevent attacks that *lead* to vulnerabilities exploited for container escape.
