# FRAGMENT Bypass Technique

## Overview

The FRAGMENT bypass technique manipulates the URL fragment identifier (#) to circumvent security controls that rely solely on the path or query parameters for authorization or validation.  The fragment identifier is client-side only; it's not sent to the server.  Therefore, a malicious actor can change the fragment to alter the client-side behavior without triggering server-side validation, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: URL Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Reliance on client-side validation or improper handling of the fragment identifier in conjunction with other security mechanisms.  This often occurs when a single-page application (SPA) relies solely on the fragment to control access to different parts of the application, without server-side validation.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to restricted resources or functionalities, data breaches, bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if improperly handled.
- **Common Targets**: Single-page applications (SPAs), applications with client-side routing that doesn't properly integrate with server-side validation, applications that use the fragment identifier for state management without proper security considerations.

## Example

Let's say a website uses the fragment to control user roles:  `https://example.com/profile#admin`.  The client-side JavaScript might check the fragment and display administrative controls if it's `#admin`.  However, the server doesn't validate this.  A regular user can simply change the URL in their browser to `https://example.com/profile#admin` and gain access to administrative features without proper authentication.  The server never receives the `#admin` part.


## How to Test

### Using curl

`curl` cannot directly test fragment bypasses because the fragment isn't sent to the server.  The test must focus on the client-side behavior.


### Using Burp Suite

1. Access the target application.  Identify a URL that uses fragments for client-side control.
2. Intercept the request using Burp Proxy.
3. Modify the fragment in the URL. For example, if the original URL is `https://example.com/dashboard#user`, change it to `https://example.com/dashboard#admin`.
4. Forward the modified request.
5. Observe the application's behavior. If the change in the fragment grants unauthorized access, then a fragment bypass is present.

### Manual Testing

1. Access the target application. Find a URL utilizing fragments (e.g., `https://example.com/page#section`).
2. Manually alter the fragment part of the URL in your browser's address bar (e.g., change `#section` to `#admin` or a non-existent section).
3. Observe the application's response.  If unauthorized functionalities or data become accessible, a FRAGMENT bypass exists.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses:**  Client-side validation, session management based solely on fragments.
- **Risks:** Data breaches, privilege escalation, unauthorized access, XSS if coupled with other vulnerabilities.
- **Real-world attack scenarios:**  An attacker could gain access to sensitive administrative panels, user data, or other restricted resources by manipulating the URL fragment.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect:**  Implement robust server-side validation for all sensitive actions, regardless of the fragment identifier.  Log suspicious fragment modifications.  Use application behavior monitoring tools.
- **Mitigation:** Never rely solely on the fragment identifier for authentication or authorization.  Always validate user permissions on the server-side. Use appropriate server-side routing and state management mechanisms.
- **Secure coding practices:**  Avoid using the fragment for critical security decisions.  Sanitize and validate all user input, including URL fragments, on the server-side.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:**  While WAFs might not directly detect fragment manipulation, they can help detect subsequent attacks triggered by the bypass (e.g., unauthorized access to sensitive data).  Focus on robust server-side validation rules.
