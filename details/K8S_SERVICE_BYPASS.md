# K8S_SERVICE_BYPASS Technique

## Overview

The K8S_SERVICE_BYPASS technique exploits misconfigurations in Kubernetes deployments that expose internal services through the Kubernetes service abstraction without proper authorization controls.  This allows attackers to access services that should only be accessible internally within the cluster, effectively bypassing intended security boundaries.  This often occurs when services are exposed using `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` services without appropriate authentication or authorization mechanisms.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: Network-level bypass, exploiting misconfigured Kubernetes service types.
- **Vulnerability**:  Improperly configured Kubernetes Services (NodePort, LoadBalancer, potentially even ClusterIP with misconfigured network policies).  Lack of authentication and authorization at the service level.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to internal Kubernetes services, potentially leading to data breaches, privilege escalation, and complete compromise of the cluster.
- **Common Targets**: Kubernetes clusters with exposed services lacking proper security controls, particularly those using NodePort or LoadBalancer service types without appropriate ingress controllers or authentication mechanisms.


## Example

Let's assume a vulnerable Kubernetes service named `my-internal-service` is exposed using a `NodePort` at port 30000 on the node with IP address `192.168.1.100`.  An attacker could directly access this service using the node's IP and the NodePort:

`http://192.168.1.100:30000`


## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl http://192.168.1.100:30000
```
(Replace `192.168.1.100:30000` with the actual node IP and NodePort)

### Using Burp Suite

1. Identify the vulnerable Kubernetes service and its NodePort or LoadBalancer IP and port.
2. Use Burp Suite's Proxy to intercept and inspect the traffic to this service.
3. Attempt to access sensitive functionalities or data through the exposed service.
4. Analyze the response for sensitive information leaks or vulnerabilities.


### Manual Testing

1. Locate the Kubernetes node IP address and the NodePort of the target service.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<node_ip>:<node_port>`.
3. Observe the response.  Successful access indicates a vulnerability.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses:** This bypasses Kubernetes' intended security model, circumventing network policies, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and other authorization mechanisms.
- **Potential Risks:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive data and applications, privilege escalation within the cluster, denial-of-service attacks targeting the exposed service.
- **Real-world attack scenarios:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive databases, internal APIs, or configuration files. This could lead to data exfiltration, manipulation, or deletion.  They could also use this access point to launch further attacks within the cluster.

## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detection:** Regularly audit Kubernetes service configurations and network policies. Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to monitor access attempts to NodePorts and LoadBalancers.
- **Mitigation:**  Use appropriate service types (ClusterIP is generally preferred for internal services), enforce robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., using an ingress controller with authentication), and implement restrictive network policies to limit access to internal services.
- **Secure coding practices:** Ensure applications running in the cluster follow secure coding practices and handle authentication and authorization correctly.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** Configure Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block malicious traffic targeting exposed services.
