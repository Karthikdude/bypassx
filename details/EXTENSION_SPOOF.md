# EXTENSION_SPOOF Bypass Technique

## Overview

EXTENSION_SPOOF is a bypass technique that leverages the manipulation of browser extensions or their perceived presence to circumvent security measures. This often involves crafting malicious requests that appear to originate from a trusted extension, thus bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions, Same-Origin Policy (SOP) checks, or other security mechanisms that rely on extension identification.  The attacker might spoof the User-Agent string or modify HTTP headers to mimic a legitimate extension's behavior, gaining unauthorized access or executing malicious code.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: HTTP Headers, User-Agent manipulation, potentially JavaScript injection if combined with other techniques.
- **Vulnerability**:  Reliance on User-Agent strings or HTTP headers for access control, weak CSP implementation that doesn't effectively block requests from spoofed extensions, inadequate validation of extension IDs.
- **Impact**:  Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, session hijacking, unauthorized access to resources, bypass of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications relying solely on User-Agent or HTTP headers for authorization, applications with weakly implemented CSP directives that allow inline scripts or eval(), applications with insecure handling of extension-related data.


## Example

Let's assume a web application checks for the presence of a "SecureBrowserExtension" (SBE) extension by looking at the User-Agent header.  A malicious actor could craft a request that includes a modified User-Agent string mimicking the SBE extension:

```http
GET /admin/panel HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 SecureBrowserExtension/1.0
```

This request might gain access to the `/admin/panel` resource, even if it's normally restricted.


## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 SpoofedExtension/1.0" "https://vulnerable-website.com/admin/panel"
```

Replace `"https://vulnerable-website.com/admin/panel"` and `"SpoofedExtension/1.0"` with the actual target URL and spoofed extension string.


### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept a request to the target application.
2. Go to the "Headers" tab.
3. Modify the "User-Agent" header to include a spoofed extension string, e.g., append "; SpoofedExtension/1.0".
4. Forward the modified request.
5. Observe if the application behaves differently based on the modified header.


### Manual Testing

1. Open the browser's developer tools (usually F12).
2. Navigate to the "Network" tab.
3. Intercept a request.
4. Modify the "User-Agent" header using the developer tools.
5. Send the modified request and observe the response.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses CSP:** This technique can bypass CSP policies that rely on source identification if the CSP is not sufficiently restrictive.
- **Bypasses SOP:** If the application uses the User-Agent to determine origin, this can allow cross-origin access.
- **Session Hijacking:** Spoofed extensions might allow access to sensitive sessions.
- **Data Exfiltration:**  Malicious code could be executed under the guise of a legitimate extension to steal data.

## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Avoid relying solely on User-Agent:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms that do not depend on User-Agent strings.
- **Strong CSP:** Implement a comprehensive CSP that minimizes the use of `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`. Use nonce-based or hash-based policies for script inclusion.
- **Validate extension IDs:** If using extension-specific functionalities, validate the extension's identity using a trusted mechanism (e.g., signed certificates, API calls).
- **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all inputs, including HTTP headers, to prevent manipulation.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- **WAF Rules:** Configure WAF rules to detect suspicious User-Agent strings or header manipulation attempts.
