# HAPROXY_STATE Bypass Technique

## Overview

The HAPROXY_STATE bypass technique exploits a potential vulnerability in web applications that rely on HAProxy's `HAPROXY_STATE` header for session management or authorization.  This header, typically used internally by HAProxy load balancers, might inadvertently leak information or allow manipulation to circumvent access controls if not properly handled by the backend application.  The core idea is to forge or manipulate this header to gain unauthorized access or privileges.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: HTTP Header Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Improper handling of the `HAPROXY_STATE` header by the backend application.  This can include trusting the header's contents without proper validation or sanitization.  A vulnerability might arise if the application uses the `HAPROXY_STATE` header to infer user roles or session data without further verification.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to restricted resources, privilege escalation, session hijacking, data breaches.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications protected by HAProxy load balancers that rely on the `HAPROXY_STATE` header for authentication or authorization without robust validation.


## Example

Let's assume a vulnerable application checks the `HAPROXY_STATE` header for a specific value ("authorized") to grant access to a sensitive page.  A legitimate request might look like this:

```http
GET /admin/panel HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
HAPROXY_STATE: authorized
```

A malicious actor could potentially bypass authentication by forging this header, even without valid credentials:

```http
GET /admin/panel HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
HAPROXY_STATE: authorized  // Forged Header
```


## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -H "HAPROXY_STATE: authorized" "https://example.com/admin/panel"
```

Replace `"https://example.com/admin/panel"` with the target URL and adjust the `HAPROXY_STATE` value as needed based on the application's expected behavior.


### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept a legitimate request to a protected resource.
2. In the request tab, add a new header: `HAPROXY_STATE` with a value to test (e.g., "authorized", "admin").
3. Forward the modified request.
4. Observe the application's response.  Successful bypass will grant unauthorized access.  Experiment with different values in the `HAPROXY_STATE` header.


### Manual Testing

1. Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to intercept and modify the HTTP request headers.
2. Add a `HAPROXY_STATE` header with different test values.
3. Observe the application's response.



## Security Implications

- **Bypasses authentication and authorization mechanisms:**  This bypass directly undermines security controls relying on the `HAPROXY_STATE` header for access control.
- **Potential for data breaches:**  If the application exposes sensitive data based on the value of the `HAPROXY_STATE` header without further checks, a successful bypass could lead to a data breach.
- **Session hijacking:** If the `HAPROXY_STATE` header contains session identifiers, forging this header could enable session hijacking.
- **Real-world attack scenarios:** A malicious actor could use this technique to gain unauthorized access to administrative panels, sensitive data, or internal systems.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect this bypass attempt:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to track unusual `HAPROXY_STATE` header values.  Analyze logs for suspicious patterns.
- **Mitigation strategies:** Never trust the `HAPROXY_STATE` header alone for authentication or authorization.  Always validate user credentials and permissions independently.
- **Secure coding practices:**  Sanitize and validate all incoming HTTP headers, including `HAPROXY_STATE`, before using them in security-sensitive operations.  Avoid implicit trust in header values.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** Configure your Web Application Firewall (WAF) to inspect and block unexpected or malformed `HAPROXY_STATE` headers. Implement robust input validation rules.
