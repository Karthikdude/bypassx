# CACHE_KEY_POISONING Bypass Technique

## Overview

Cache key poisoning is a technique where an attacker manipulates the parameters used to generate cache keys, forcing the application to serve poisoned or malicious content from its cache. This bypasses traditional input validation mechanisms because the attacker doesn't directly modify the displayed data but rather the key used to retrieve it from the cache.  The poisoned content can range from altered data to malicious code injections, depending on the application's logic and the vulnerability exploited.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: URL Manipulation, Parameter Tampering, HTTP Headers (depending on cache implementation)
- **Vulnerability**: Improper cache key generation, lack of input sanitization for cache key parameters, predictable cache key generation algorithms.  This often stems from vulnerabilities like insecure direct object references (IDOR) or lack of proper input validation on parameters contributing to the cache key.
- **Impact**:  Serving malicious content to legitimate users, data manipulation, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), denial-of-service (DoS) attacks (via cache exhaustion).
- **Common Targets**: Web applications with caching mechanisms (e.g., Varnish, Redis, Memcached), content delivery networks (CDNs), applications using caching to improve performance.

## Example

Let's assume a vulnerable e-commerce site uses a cache key generated like this: `product_cache_{product_id}`.  If the `product_id` is retrieved directly from a GET parameter without sanitization, an attacker might craft a URL like:  `/product.php?product_id=1%27%20OR%201=1--`.  This crafted `product_id` might produce a cache key like `product_cache_{1'%20OR%201=1--}`.  If the application then uses this key to fetch and display data from the database (without further checks), this SQL injection could retrieve all products, circumventing any access controls.  A less direct attack could inject JavaScript if the application displays the data un-escaped.

## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
# Assuming vulnerable URL is /product.php?product_id=1
curl "http://vulnerable-site.com/product.php?product_id=1' OR 1=1-- "
```
This example attempts a SQL injection.  Adapt the payload to the specific vulnerability.

### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept the request for a legitimate resource.
2. Identify the parameters that contribute to the cache key.
3. Modify the parameters systematically to attempt cache poisoning.  Use Burp Suite's Intruder feature for automated attacks.  Payloads can include SQL injection, XSS, or other relevant attacks.
4. Observe the application's responses to determine if the cache is serving poisoned content.

### Manual Testing

1. Access a cached resource in a browser (e.g., a product page).
2. Inspect the network requests to identify parameters that might affect cache keys.
3. Modify these parameters, attempting to craft malicious keys.
4. Reload the page and monitor the application's response to check for poisoned content.

## Security Implications

- **Bypasses input validation:** Attackers bypasses input validation by manipulating cache keys.
- **Data breaches:**  Poisoned cache can lead to sensitive data exposure.
- **Code execution:**  In some cases, attackers could inject malicious code.
- **Denial of Service:**  Cache exhaustion attacks are possible.

## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Secure cache key generation:** Use unpredictable, cryptographically secure functions to generate cache keys.  Avoid directly using user inputs.
- **Input validation and sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize *all* parameters used in generating cache keys, even if they are not displayed directly.
- **Output encoding:**  Always encode data before displaying it to the user to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Regular security audits:**  Conduct regular penetration tests and security assessments to identify vulnerabilities.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) configured to detect and block malicious cache key patterns and SQL injection. Implement rate-limiting to prevent cache exhaustion attacks.
- **Least privilege:** Ensure the application has minimal database access privileges necessary for its operation.
