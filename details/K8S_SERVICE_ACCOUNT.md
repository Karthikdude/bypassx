# K8S_SERVICE_ACCOUNT Bypass Technique

## Overview

This technique exploits the misconfiguration or lack of proper authorization checks around Kubernetes Service Accounts to gain unauthorized access to resources within a Kubernetes cluster.  Attackers might leverage this to access sensitive data, deploy malicious pods, or escalate privileges within the cluster. This bypass often occurs when applications directly rely on Service Account tokens without sufficient validation or when the Service Account has overly permissive roles.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: Authentication Bypass (Improper Authorization)
- **Vulnerability**: Improper Access Control, Insufficient Authorization, Weak Authentication relying on Kubernetes Service Accounts.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to Kubernetes resources, data breaches, privilege escalation, deployment of malicious pods, complete cluster compromise.
- **Common Targets**: Applications running inside Kubernetes clusters that use Service Account tokens without proper validation and authorization checks.  This is particularly prevalent in microservices architectures.


## Example

Let's assume an application running in a Kubernetes pod uses a Service Account token to access a sensitive database.  If the application doesn't properly verify the token's permissions or the intended audience, an attacker might be able to:

1.  Obtain the Service Account token (e.g., through a compromised pod, misconfigured secrets management, or other vulnerabilities).
2.  Use this token to impersonate the Service Account and make unauthorized requests to the database or other Kubernetes API endpoints.

A simplified example (illustrative, not for direct execution without appropriate context):

```bash
# Assuming the attacker has obtained the token:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <stolen_service_account_token>" \
     https://kubernetes.default.svc/apis/apps/v1/deployments
```


## How to Test

This test requires access to a Kubernetes cluster and requires ethical hacking permissions.  Do not attempt this on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

### Using curl

The `curl` example above demonstrates the basic principle.  You'd replace `<stolen_service_account_token>` with an actual token. The URL would be adjusted depending on the target API endpoint.

### Using Burp Suite

1.  Capture the HTTP request made by the vulnerable application using Burp Suite's proxy.
2.  Identify the authorization header containing the Service Account token.
3.  Modify the request to replace the token with a potentially compromised or stolen token.  
4.  Replay the modified request and observe the response.  Unauthorized access indicates a successful bypass.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing would involve inspecting the application's code (if possible) to understand how it uses Service Accounts and whether appropriate authorization checks are in place. This is often done by examining configuration files like deployment YAMLs.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses**: This bypasses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms implemented within Kubernetes.
- **Potential Risks**: Data breaches, unauthorized deployments, complete cluster takeover, denial-of-service attacks.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios**: An attacker compromising a pod with a Service Account might gain access to resources it shouldn't have access to.  A misconfigured secret containing the token could also lead to complete compromise.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect**: Implement Kubernetes auditing and logging to monitor API activity for suspicious access attempts using Service Accounts.  Regularly review audit logs for unauthorized actions.
- **Mitigation**: Implement least privilege principle for Service Accounts. Only grant necessary permissions to Service Accounts. Use Kubernetes RBAC effectively to restrict access.  Regularly rotate Service Account tokens.  Use more secure authentication methods where possible (e.g., mTLS).
- **Secure Coding Practices**:  Never hardcode Service Account tokens in application code. Use Kubernetes secrets management to securely store and access tokens. Always validate tokens and their associated permissions before granting access to resources.
- **WAF/security tool configurations**: While WAFs are not a primary defense against this type of bypass, they might help in detecting anomalous traffic patterns that could indicate exploitation.
