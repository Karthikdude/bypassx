# APACHE_MOD_REWRITE Bypass Technique

## Overview

This technique exploits weaknesses in how Apache's `mod_rewrite` engine handles URL rewriting rules, potentially bypassing intended security measures like input validation or authorization checks.  By carefully crafting malicious requests, an attacker can manipulate the rewritten URL to gain unauthorized access to resources or execute unintended actions. This often involves manipulating parameters within the rewrite rules themselves, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: URL Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Misconfigured or insecurely implemented `mod_rewrite` rules in Apache web servers.  This often stems from improper escaping, insufficient input validation within the rewrite rules, or relying on `mod_rewrite` for security checks instead of proper application-level validation.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to restricted resources, bypass of authentication mechanisms, injection attacks (e.g., path traversal, command injection if poorly implemented), and privilege escalation.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications running on Apache servers with `mod_rewrite` enabled and employing it for URL rewriting, routing, or (incorrectly) security filtering.


## Example

Let's assume a vulnerable application uses `mod_rewrite` to redirect requests to a specific controller based on the URL path:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^/admin/(.*)$ /admin_controller.php?param=$1 [L]
```

A legitimate request to `/admin/dashboard` would be rewritten to `/admin_controller.php?param=dashboard`.

A potential bypass could involve manipulating the `param` value:

- **Path Traversal:** `/admin/../../etc/passwd` could potentially allow reading the system's password file if the `admin_controller.php` script doesn't properly sanitize the `param` input.
- **Directory traversal:** `/admin/../` might be able to bypass authorization checks if not properly handled.
- **Parameter Tampering:**  Injecting special characters or encoding might alter the interpretation of the rewrite rule leading to unexpected behavior, potentially resulting in access to unexpected files or functionality.

## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -v "http://vulnerable-target.com/admin/../../etc/passwd"
```
This attempts a path traversal attack.  Replace `vulnerable-target.com` with the target URL.

### Using Burp Suite

1. **Proxy:** Configure Burp Suite as your browser's proxy.
2. **Intercept:** Intercept the HTTP request for a URL that utilizes `mod_rewrite`.
3. **Modify:**  Edit the request URL to introduce potential bypasses (e.g., path traversal, parameter manipulation, adding special characters).  For instance, change `/admin/dashboard` to `/admin/../../etc/passwd` or `/admin/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd` (URL-encoded path traversal).
4. **Forward:** Forward the modified request and observe the response.  Check if unexpected content or functionality is accessible.  Repeat with different variations.

### Manual Testing

Manually test by constructing malicious URLs in your browser.  Experiment with path traversal attempts (using `../`), URL encoding of special characters, or modifying parameters within the rewritten URL structure to observe if the application's behavior deviates from the expected outcome.

## Security Implications

- **Bypasses Input Validation:** This bypasses input validation mechanisms that might be implemented in the application if the `mod_rewrite` rule is not properly handled at the server-side.
- **Circumvents Authentication:**  Attackers could bypass authentication checks if the rewrite rules are not properly integrated with authentication mechanisms.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Data:**  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or system files.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (indirectly):**  While not directly an `mod_rewrite` vulnerability, poorly handled outputs from a rewritten request can result in RCE vulnerabilities in the back-end application.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation within the application itself, rather than relying solely on `mod_rewrite` for security checks.  Never trust user-supplied data.
- **Proper Sanitization:** Sanitize all parameters passed to the rewritten scripts. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection attacks.
- **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the webserver and related processes run with the principle of least privilege.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Disable `mod_rewrite` if unnecessary:** If not required for legitimate functionality, consider disabling `mod_rewrite` to mitigate the potential risks.
- **WAF Configuration:** Configure your Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block malicious patterns associated with path traversal and other potential exploits related to `mod_rewrite`.

Note: This documentation provides a general overview.  The specifics of exploiting and mitigating `mod_rewrite` vulnerabilities depend heavily on the specific implementation and configuration of the web application and Apache server.  Always prioritize secure coding practices and proper input validation to prevent such attacks.
