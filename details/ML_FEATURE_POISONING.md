# ML_FEATURE_POISONING Bypass Technique

## Overview

ML_FEATURE_POISONING is a bypass technique that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that utilize machine learning (ML) models for security purposes, such as spam filtering, fraud detection, or intrusion detection.  This technique involves injecting malicious data into the training dataset or input data fed to the ML model, causing the model to misclassify or misbehave in a predictable way, effectively bypassing its intended security function.  Instead of directly attacking the application's code, this attack targets the underlying ML model's logic and its data.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: Data Manipulation, Model Evasion
- **Vulnerability**: Reliance on vulnerable or inadequately trained/tested ML models for security decisions; lack of input sanitization or validation before feeding data to the ML model; lack of monitoring for model drift or performance degradation.
- **Impact**: Bypass of security controls based on the ML model, leading to successful attacks like spam email delivery, fraudulent transactions, or unauthorized access.  This can cause significant financial losses, reputational damage, and data breaches.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications using ML models for spam filtering, fraud detection, intrusion detection, content moderation, and risk assessment.


## Example

Imagine a web application using an ML model to detect malicious login attempts based on features like IP address, login time, and password complexity.  An attacker could flood the system with many legitimate login attempts from various IP addresses and times, but with very weak passwords.  This would bias the ML model to classify weak passwords as less suspicious, even if they are associated with unusual login patterns.  Subsequently, the attacker could easily bypass the login security by using a weak password, even from a suspicious IP.


## How to Test

**Note:**  Ethical considerations are paramount.  Only perform these tests on systems you have explicit permission to test.


### Using curl

This technique is not directly testable via `curl` alone as it requires manipulating the training data or the input data stream over time, not just a single request.  `curl` can be used to send individual poisoned data points, but the impact would only be observable after repeated poisoning and potential retraining of the model.

### Using Burp Suite

1. **Identify the input**: Determine how the application feeds data to the ML model.  This might involve analyzing network traffic to identify API endpoints or form submissions used for risk assessment or authentication.
2. **Craft poisoned data**: Based on the identified input, create data points that are designed to mislead the ML model. This might involve crafting seemingly legitimate but unusual data points, slowly modifying the feature distribution, or generating adversarial examples using tools specific to ML model manipulation.
3. **Iterative testing**: Send the poisoned data using Burp's proxy.  Monitor the application's response and observe whether the ML model's decisions are altered.  Multiple iterations are necessary to observe the effect of the poisoning.  Analyzing the model's output directly may not be possible without access to the internals. Observe behavioral changes in the application, such as unexpected approvals or access grants.
4. **Analyze results**: After a sufficient number of poisoned data points have been sent, assess if the ML model’s behavior has changed in the desired manner.

### Manual Testing

Similar to Burp Suite, manual testing requires identifying input points for the ML model and injecting carefully crafted data to observe the model’s reaction.  This will be slow and might require repeated actions, but allows for observing the application's response without specialized tools.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses:** This technique bypasses ML-based security controls, rendering them ineffective.
- **Potential Risks:** Data breaches, financial losses, reputational damage, unauthorized access, and successful fraudulent activities.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios:**  Bypassing spam filters, evading fraud detection systems, manipulating content moderation algorithms, or achieving unauthorized access to sensitive systems.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect**: Monitor the ML model's performance metrics regularly, looking for unexpected changes in accuracy, false positive/negative rates, and model drift.  Implement anomaly detection on the input data stream.
- **Mitigation**: Use robust data sanitization and validation techniques before feeding data to the ML model. Implement input filtering and outlier detection.  Employ diverse and representative training data. Regularly retrain the model with updated datasets. Use model explainability techniques to understand model decisions and detect anomalies. Consider using ensemble methods and robust ML algorithms less susceptible to poisoning.  Implement layered security controls that don't solely rely on ML.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding best practices to prevent other vulnerabilities that could be exploited in conjunction with feature poisoning.
- **WAF/security tool configurations**:  While WAFs themselves won't directly mitigate this, they can help protect against other vulnerabilities that an attacker might exploit to gain access and subsequently inject poisoned data.
