# GRAPHQL_INTROSPECTION Bypass Technique

## Overview

GraphQL introspection allows clients to query the GraphQL schema, revealing details about available types, fields, and their relationships. While useful for development and documentation, if enabled in a production environment, it exposes sensitive information about the application's data model and potential vulnerabilities.  Attackers can leverage this information to craft targeted attacks, bypassing authentication or authorization controls and potentially exfiltrating sensitive data.  This technique bypasses security measures by providing a blueprint of the application's data structure.

## Technical Details

- **Method**:  HTTP Request (POST typically, but GET can also work depending on server implementation)
- **Vulnerability**:  Improperly configured GraphQL server with introspection enabled.
- **Impact**: Data leakage (schema discovery, field types, argument types, etc.), enabling further attacks based on the exposed schema.  This can lead to unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, and business logic flaws exploitation.
- **Common Targets**:  Applications using GraphQL APIs without proper security configurations, particularly those with insufficient authorization checks.


## Example

Let's assume a GraphQL server with a `User` type containing fields like `id`, `username`, and `email`.  A GraphQL introspection query would look like this:

```graphql
query IntrospectionQuery {
  __schema {
    queryType {
      name
    }
    types {
      ...FullType
    }
  }
}

fragment FullType on __Type {
  kind
  name
  description
  fields {
    name
    description
    args {
      name
      description
      type {
        ...TypeRef
      }
    }
    type {
      ...TypeRef
    }
  }
  inputFields {
    name
    description
    type {
      ...TypeRef
    }
  }
  interfaces {
    ...TypeRef
  }
  enumValues(includeDeprecated: true) {
    name
    description
    isDeprecated
    deprecationReason
  }
  possibleTypes {
    name
  }
}

fragment TypeRef on __Type {
  kind
  name
  ofType {
    kind
    name
    ofType {
      kind
      name
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return the entire schema, revealing the `User` type and its fields, allowing an attacker to construct further queries to extract data.


## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "query IntrospectionQuery { __schema { queryType { name } types { ...FullType } } } fragment FullType on __Type { kind name description fields { name description args { name description type { ...TypeRef } } type { ...TypeRef } } inputFields { name description type { ...TypeRef } } interfaces { ...TypeRef } enumValues(includeDeprecated: true) { name description isDeprecated deprecationReason } possibleTypes { name } } fragment TypeRef on __Type { kind name ofType { kind name ofType { kind name } } } }"}' \
  <GraphQL_endpoint>
```
Replace `<GraphQL_endpoint>` with the actual endpoint of the GraphQL API.

### Using Burp Suite

1. Send a POST request to the GraphQL endpoint with the introspection query (as shown in the curl example) to the target.
2. Intercept the request in Burp Suite's Proxy.
3. Examine the response.  A successful introspection will return a detailed JSON representation of the GraphQL schema.

### Manual Testing

1. Use the browser's developer tools (usually accessed by pressing F12) to open the Network tab.
2. Make a GraphQL request to the endpoint (e.g., through a GraphQL client library in your application or a dedicated GraphQL IDE like GraphiQL).  Send the introspection query.
3. Observe the response in the Network tab.  The response should contain the schema if introspection is enabled.



## Security Implications

- **Bypasses Authentication and Authorization:** Attackers can use the schema information to bypass authorization checks by crafting queries that target specific fields or data they shouldn't have access to.
- **Data Breaches:**  The schema reveals data structures, allowing targeted data extraction.
- **Business Logic Exploits:** Understanding the data model enables the discovery of potential vulnerabilities in the application's business logic.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While not directly a bypass, overly complex queries generated based on introspection could lead to DoS attacks through resource exhaustion.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Disable Introspection in Production:**  The most effective defense is to disable introspection in production environments.
- **Implement Robust Authorization:**  Even with introspection enabled, strong authorization mechanisms are crucial to prevent unauthorized data access.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to mitigate potential DoS attacks from abusive introspection queries.
- **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all incoming GraphQL queries to prevent injection attacks.
- **WAF/Security Tool Configurations:**  Configure your WAF to detect and block known introspection queries.
- **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities in your GraphQL API.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding best practices when developing GraphQL APIs.

  *Note:  There are not typically specific CVEs directly tied to GraphQL introspection *itself*, as it's a feature that's vulnerable when improperly used.  The vulnerabilities arise from the lack of proper authorization and protection around a *potentially* exposed schema.*
