# CF_CONNECTING_IP_BYPASS Technique

## Overview

The `CF_CONNECTING_IP` bypass technique exploits the reliance of some web applications on the `CF-CONNECTING-IP` HTTP header for geolocation or access control.  This header, often provided by CloudFlare, represents the original client IP address. However, malicious actors can manipulate or forge this header, bypassing geographic restrictions, IP-based rate limiting, or other security mechanisms that depend solely on this header for validation.  This bypass is particularly effective when the application doesn't perform adequate validation of the client's IP address against other sources of information.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: HTTP Header Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Improper validation of the `CF-CONNECTING-IP` header, relying solely on this header for security decisions (e.g., geolocation, access control, rate limiting).
- **Impact**: Bypassing geographic restrictions, circumventing rate limiting, gaining unauthorized access to resources, performing malicious activities like DDoS amplification.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications using CloudFlare or similar services for CDN or security features without proper backend IP address validation. Applications that use `CF-CONNECTING-IP` as the sole source of trust for access control.

## Example

Let's assume a web application restricts access based solely on the `CF-CONNECTING-IP` header, only allowing access from IPs within a specific range.  A malicious actor can craft a request with a forged `CF-CONNECTING-IP` header to bypass this restriction:

Original Request (blocked):
```
GET /restricted-resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.100
```

Modified Request (bypass attempt):
```
GET /restricted-resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.100
CF-CONNECTING-IP: 10.0.0.10
```
If the application only checks `CF-CONNECTING-IP`, the request will likely be accepted, even if the real client IP is outside the allowed range.


## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -H "CF-CONNECTING-IP: 8.8.8.8" "https://example.com/restricted-resource"
```
Replace `8.8.8.8` with the desired forged IP and `https://example.com/restricted-resource` with the target URL.

### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept the request to the target resource.
2. In the request's HTTP headers tab, add a `CF-CONNECTING-IP` header with the desired forged IP address.
3. Forward the modified request.

### Manual Testing

1. Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) to intercept the request.
2. Modify the request headers to include a `CF-CONNECTING-IP` header with a forged IP address.
3. Send the modified request.

## Security Implications

- **Bypasses:** This technique bypasses IP-based access controls, geolocation restrictions, and rate limiting mechanisms that solely rely on the `CF-CONNECTING-IP` header.
- **Risks:** Unauthorized access to sensitive resources, data breaches, DDoS amplification attacks, and circumvention of security measures.
- **Real-world scenarios:** Malicious actors could use this to access geographically restricted content, conduct DDoS attacks by spoofing their IP addresses, or gain access to internal systems.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detection:**  Log and monitor `CF-CONNECTING-IP` values, comparing them with the actual client IP address (`X-Forwarded-For` or the server's received IP).  Any significant discrepancy warrants investigation. Implement anomaly detection systems to detect unusual patterns in `CF-CONNECTING-IP` headers.
- **Mitigation:**  Never rely solely on the `CF-CONNECTING-IP` header for security decisions.  Always validate the client's IP address using other methods, such as checking the IP address received directly by the server. Employ multiple layers of security.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Implement robust IP address validation routines. Don't trust header values without proper verification. Use a whitelist approach for allowed IP addresses whenever feasible.
- **WAF/Security Tool Configurations:** Configure your Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block requests with suspicious or manipulated `CF-CONNECTING-IP` headers.  Enable logging and alerts for unusual header patterns.
