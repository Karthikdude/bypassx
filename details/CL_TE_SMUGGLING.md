# CL_TE_SMUGGLING Bypass Technique

## Overview

CL_TE_SMUGGLING, or Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding Smuggling, is a bypass technique that leverages inconsistencies in how web servers handle the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` HTTP headers.  It allows an attacker to inject malicious data beyond the expected content length, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), or other vulnerabilities. This works by sending a response with both a `Content-Length` header and a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header. The server may improperly handle the combination leading to the processing of data beyond the specified `Content-Length`.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: HTTP Headers Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Improper handling of `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers by web servers and applications.  This often stems from a lack of robust parsing and validation of HTTP headers.
- **Impact**:  Successful exploitation can lead to various attacks, including XSS, SSRF, arbitrary file upload, code execution (in severe cases), data breaches, and session hijacking.  The impact heavily depends on the context and the injected payload.
- **Common Targets**: Web servers and applications that do not properly validate and handle the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` HTTP headers in their response processing logic. Older or poorly maintained applications are particularly vulnerable.

## Example

Let's assume a vulnerable web server returns a response with both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.  An attacker might send a request that triggers such a response and then adds malicious data after the declared `Content-Length`.

A simplified example (the exact behavior may vary depending on the server):

**Vulnerable Server Response (incorrect):**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 10
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
... some data (10 bytes)...
0
```

**Attacker's Malicious Request (injecting after Content-Length):**

The attacker might inject malicious data after the initial 10 bytes. The server might process this additional data due to the presence of `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`, leading to a vulnerability.  Note that this is a simplified example. Real-world exploitation often involves more sophisticated techniques.

## How to Test

### Using curl

This requires crafting a specific request that triggers a response with both headers, then appending data after the expected length. This is complex and often requires intimate knowledge of the target application. A simple example illustrating the principle (unlikely to be directly exploitable):

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" -d "10\r\nhello world\r\n0\r\n" -X POST  http://vulnerable-server/endpoint
```
This example sends a chunked body containing "hello world" (11 bytes).  The `Content-Length` is often implicit in this scenario rather than explicitly set.


### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept the vulnerable HTTP response in Burp Suite's proxy.
2. Identify the `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` headers.
3. Modify the response:  After the data corresponding to `Content-Length`, inject your malicious payload.
4. Forward the modified response to the server.
5. Observe the server's behavior and check for any vulnerabilities.
6. You might need to adjust the payload to bypass any filtering mechanisms.


### Manual Testing

Manual testing involves using browser developer tools (like the Network tab in Chrome) to intercept and modify the HTTP response similar to Burp Suite's method.  However, manual testing is much harder and less precise.

## Security Implications

- **Bypass of Security Controls:** This bypasses input validation checks that rely solely on `Content-Length` for data size verification.
- **Potential Risks:**  XSS, SSRF, arbitrary file upload, remote code execution, and data breaches are all potential consequences.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios:**  An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via XSS, leading to session hijacking or data theft.  They might exploit SSRF to access internal resources or perform actions on behalf of the server.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect this bypass attempt:** Monitor server logs for unusual HTTP header combinations (`Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` together) and unexpected large responses. Use a robust Web Application Firewall (WAF).
- **Mitigation Strategies:**  Implement strict validation of both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`. Only accept one of these headers; disallow the combination, or handle both consistently.  Normalize and sanitize user inputs rigorously.
- **Secure coding practices:**  Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent header manipulation vulnerabilities. Properly handle HTTP requests and responses.  Use a strong input validation and output encoding.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** Configure your WAF to detect and block requests with suspicious header combinations or oversized responses.  Regularly update and maintain security tools.
