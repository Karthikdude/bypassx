# EDGE_LOCATION_BYPASS Technique

## Overview

The EDGE_LOCATION_BYPASS technique exploits weaknesses in web applications that rely solely on the `X-Forwarded-For` (XFF) header or similar headers to determine the user's geographic location for access control or content delivery.  This bypass manipulates the XFF header to spoof the user's IP address, thereby circumventing geographic restrictions intended to limit access based on location.  The application fails to validate the header's authenticity or cross-references it with other reliable location indicators.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: HTTP Header Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of client location information; over-reliance on the `X-Forwarded-For` header for geolocation.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to geographically restricted content or functionalities.  Data breaches, intellectual property theft, or violation of regulations (e.g., GDPR) if sensitive data is exposed.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications with regional access control, streaming services with geo-blocking, online banking systems with location-based security, and services that tailor content based on user location.


## Example

Let's assume a streaming service blocks access from outside the United States.  A legitimate user in the US will have their request sent with a `X-Forwarded-For` header reflecting their US IP address (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.2.1`).  However, an attacker can use a proxy or manipulate the header to bypass the restriction:

```http
X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.2.1, 104.23.24.1
```

This example shows an attacker spoofing their IP as `192.0.2.1` (a US address) while the proxy's IP address (`104.23.24.1`) which could be located elsewhere is included. If the application only checks the first IP, the restriction will be bypassed.

## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: 192.0.2.1" "https://target.example.com/restricted-content"
```

This command sends a request to the target URL with a spoofed `X-Forwarded-For` header. Replace `192.0.2.1` with a desired IP address and `https://target.example.com/restricted-content` with the actual URL.

### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept a request to a geographically restricted resource.
2. Go to the "HTTP Headers" tab.
3. Add or modify the `X-Forwarded-For` header to include a desired IP address (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For: 172.217.160.142`). This IP address is example IP.  You should choose a different one.
4. Forward the modified request.

### Manual Testing

1. Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12).
2. Navigate to the "Network" tab.
3. Intercept a request to a geographically restricted resource.
4. Modify the request headers and add or change the `X-Forwarded-For` header to a desired IP address.
5. Send the modified request.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses:** This bypasses geographic restrictions implemented based solely on `X-Forwarded-For` header analysis.  It circumvents location-based access control mechanisms.
- **Potential Risks:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, violation of data privacy regulations, intellectual property theft, and service abuse.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios:**  Malicious actors could gain access to restricted content, manipulate data, or perform denial-of-service attacks by overwhelming the server with requests from spoofed locations.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect:** Implement robust server-side logging to monitor unusual XFF header values.  Analyze log entries for inconsistencies and suspicious patterns.  Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect and alert on anomalous requests.
- **Mitigation:**  Do not rely solely on the `X-Forwarded-For` header for geolocation.  Use more robust methods like checking the client's IP address directly (with appropriate considerations for reverse proxies), geolocation databases, or reverse DNS lookups. Cross-reference location data from multiple sources.
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Validate all user-supplied input, including HTTP headers.  Implement input sanitization and validation routines to prevent header manipulation.
- **WAF/Security Tool Configurations:** Configure your web application firewall (WAF) to analyze and block requests with suspicious `X-Forwarded-For` headers (e.g., headers with multiple IPs, or IPs from known malicious sources).
