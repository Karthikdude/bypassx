# CASE_MIXED Bypass Technique

## Overview

CASE_MIXED is a bypass technique that exploits vulnerabilities in input validation routines that rely on case-sensitive comparisons.  Many applications perform input validation by checking if an input string exactly matches a predefined allowed value or pattern.  If the comparison is case-sensitive, an attacker can bypass the validation by altering the case of characters in the input, creating a slightly different string that passes validation without being detected.


## Technical Details

- **Method**: Input manipulation, specifically altering the case of characters.
- **Vulnerability**:  Insufficient input validation, specifically relying on case-sensitive string comparisons instead of case-insensitive comparisons. This often arises in authentication, authorization, or data filtering mechanisms.
- **Impact**:  Unauthorized access, data manipulation, privilege escalation, depending on the specific application and the context of the vulnerability.  A successful bypass can lead to a complete compromise of the web application.
- **Common Targets**:  Login forms, registration forms, file upload functionalities, search filters, and any form accepting user-supplied data where a case-sensitive check is implemented poorly.


## Example

Let's assume a login form expects the username "admin".  A case-sensitive validation would fail for "Admin", "ADMIN", or "aDmin".  The CASE_MIXED bypass exploits this by submitting "Admin" (or any other case variation) instead of the expected "admin".


## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=Admin&password=password123" <target_url>
```
This command attempts to log in using "Admin" instead of "admin", assuming the target URL is a login form.  Replace `<target_url>` and "password123" with appropriate values.

### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept the login request to the target application.
2. In the request parameters, modify the `username` parameter to a case-mixed variant, e.g., change "admin" to "Admin".
3. Forward the modified request.
4. Observe the application's response. If the login is successful, the CASE_MIXED bypass is effective.

### Manual Testing

1. Access the vulnerable web application.
2. Identify a form requiring a specific input, e.g., a username or filename.
3. Try submitting the input with altered capitalization.  Experiment with different capitalization combinations.
4. Observe whether the application accepts the modified input despite the case difference.



## Security Implications

- **Bypasses security controls:** It directly bypasses input validation rules relying on case-sensitive comparison, potentially circumventing authentication, authorization, and access control mechanisms.
- **Potential risks and impacts:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, privilege escalation, and application compromise.
- **Real-world attack scenarios:**  An attacker could use this to gain unauthorized access to an admin panel, modify sensitive data, or escalate privileges within the application.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect this bypass attempt:**  Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect unusual login attempts or access patterns.  Review logs for requests containing unexpected capitalization.
- **Mitigation strategies:**  Use case-insensitive string comparisons for all input validations where case should not matter.  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, which can be combined with this technique.
- **Secure coding practices:**  Always validate input thoroughly and consistently.  Avoid hardcoding sensitive values (like usernames). Utilize appropriate data validation functions provided by the programming language.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:**  Configure Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to detect and block unusual capitalization patterns if feasible.  However, relying solely on WAFs is not sufficient.

- Parameter tampering
- Directory traversal (if the case-sensitive validation is applied to file paths)
