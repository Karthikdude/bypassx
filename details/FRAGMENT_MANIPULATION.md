# FRAGMENT_MANIPULATION Bypass Technique

## Overview

Fragment manipulation exploits the behavior of web browsers concerning the URL fragment identifier (the part of a URL following a `#` symbol).  While the fragment itself isn't sent to the server, manipulating it can be used to bypass client-side validation or cause unexpected behavior in the application if the application improperly relies on the fragment for its logic. This often leads to issues when the fragment is used to control state changes within a single-page application (SPA) or if a server-side component unexpectedly uses the fragment for authentication or authorization decisions.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: URL Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Improper handling of URL fragments, insecure client-side validation, lack of proper state management in SPAs.  Often combined with other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or broken access control.
- **Impact**:  Unauthorized access to resources, data modification, bypass of authentication mechanisms, redirection to malicious sites (if combined with other techniques).
- **Common Targets**: Single-page applications (SPAs) that rely heavily on client-side routing and state management using URL fragments, applications with inconsistent validation between client and server.

## Example

Let's say a vulnerable application uses the fragment to control user roles.  A legitimate URL might be: `/profile#role=admin`.  The application only checks the fragment on the client-side, allowing a user to modify the fragment to gain unauthorized access.  A malicious user could change the URL to `/profile#role=user` to change their permissions.  This may be insufficient for higher privilege access but, depending on the application's logic, could still be exploitable.

## How to Test

### Using curl

`curl` cannot directly test fragment manipulation because the fragment is not sent to the server.  The test needs to be performed through a browser or a tool that simulates browser behavior.

### Using Burp Suite

1. **Intercept the request:** Intercept the HTTP request to the vulnerable application in Burp Suite's Proxy.
2. **Modify the URL:**  In the request URL, modify the fragment identifier. For example, if the original URL is `/page?id=1`, change it to `/page?id=1#malicious_fragment`.
3. **Forward the request:** Forward the modified request to the server.
4. **Observe the response:** Examine the application's response to see if the fragment manipulation resulted in unintended behavior or a security vulnerability.  Pay close attention to client-side changes or errors.

### Manual Testing

1. **Open the target URL:** Navigate to the vulnerable application in your web browser.
2. **Modify the fragment:** Manually edit the URL in the browser's address bar, changing the fragment identifier.
3. **Observe the application's behavior:** Check if the modification of the fragment changes the application's behavior, granting access to unauthorized features or resources.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses client-side validation:**  The server does not receive the fragment, so client-side checks are easily bypassed.
- **Potential for session hijacking:** If the fragment is used to manage session data, manipulation could lead to session hijacking.
- **Information leakage:** Manipulating the fragment might reveal information about the application's internal state or logic.
- **Real-world attack scenarios:** An attacker could use this technique to escalate privileges, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect:**  Implement robust server-side validation to check user permissions and roles independently of the URL fragment.
- **Mitigate:**  Avoid relying on URL fragments for critical application logic or state management. Use cookies or server-side sessions instead. Employ comprehensive input validation and sanitization.
- **Secure coding practices:** Never trust client-side input. Always perform server-side validation to verify the user's identity and authorization.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** While a WAF might not directly detect fragment manipulation, it can help mitigate related vulnerabilities, such as XSS.
