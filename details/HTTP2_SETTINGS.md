# HTTP2_SETTINGS Bypass Technique

## Overview

The HTTP2_SETTINGS bypass technique exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that improperly handle or validate HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames.  Attackers can manipulate these frames to potentially bypass security mechanisms like input validation or authorization checks.  This isn't a direct vulnerability in HTTP/2 itself but rather a consequence of insecure implementations that fail to correctly sanitize or validate data within these frames.  The effectiveness depends heavily on the specific application's logic and how it processes HTTP/2 SETTINGS.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: HTTP Headers Manipulation (specifically, HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames)
- **Vulnerability**: Insecure handling of HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames, lack of proper input validation, improper authorization checks within the application's handling of SETTINGS.
- **Impact**:  Depending on the specific vulnerability, successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches,  denial-of-service, or complete server compromise.  It can allow bypassing authentication, authorization, or input validation mechanisms.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications using HTTP/2 and implementing custom logic to process HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames without sufficient validation.  This is less common with well-established frameworks that handle these frames securely.


## Example

Let's assume a vulnerable application checks for a specific user agent in the HTTP request headers. A malicious actor might try to inject malicious data into a custom SETTINGS parameter, hoping it's processed in a way that affects the application's user agent check or other security logic.  This is highly application-specific and requires a detailed understanding of the target application's code.  A direct example is difficult to provide without knowledge of the specific target's vulnerabilities.

For instance, a hypothetical vulnerable application might look for a specific setting to grant access.  The attacker could try to modify a SETTINGS frame to inject this setting even if they are unauthorized.  This example is illustrative; the specific SETTINGS parameter and its effect will vary significantly depending on the target application.


## How to Test

**This technique requires a deep understanding of the target application's behavior and potential vulnerabilities.** Generic testing is unlikely to succeed.

### Using curl

Directly manipulating HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames with `curl` requires advanced knowledge of HTTP/2 framing and is usually not straightforward.  Standard `curl` options won't directly allow this.  Specialized tools or custom scripts would be needed.

### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept an HTTP/2 request to the target application.
2. Proxy the request using Burp Suite.
3. Navigate to the HTTP/2 tab in Burp's request editor.
4. (**This is where specific knowledge of the target application is crucial**) Attempt to modify existing SETTINGS parameters or add new ones, carefully observing the application's response.  This might involve adding parameters with potentially malicious values.
5. Forward the modified request to the server and analyze the response for any unexpected behavior.  Observe if any sensitive data or functionalities become accessible.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing is extremely difficult for this technique. It requires low-level HTTP/2 protocol manipulation which is best done using tools.  Manually constructing and injecting HTTP/2 frames into browser requests is highly impractical.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses:** Input validation, authorization checks, authentication mechanisms.
- **Potential Risks:** Unauthorized access, data exfiltration, denial-of-service, remote code execution (in extreme cases if the application logic is severely flawed).
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios:**  A malicious actor could bypass authentication by injecting a custom setting that alters how the server identifies a user's privileges.  Another scenario is manipulating a setting that modifies input validation rules, leading to injection attacks.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect:** Implement robust logging and monitoring of HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames.  Look for unusual patterns or unexpected values in these frames.  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) should be configured to detect anomalous HTTP/2 traffic.
- **Mitigation:** Implement strong input validation for all parameters received through HTTP/2, including SETTINGS frames.  Ensure that only expected SETTINGS parameters are processed.  Avoid directly using user-supplied data in sensitive logic without proper sanitization.  Principle of least privilege should be strictly enforced.
- **Secure Coding Practices:**  Use well-vetted and secure libraries and frameworks for handling HTTP/2.  Avoid custom implementations unless absolutely necessary.
- **WAF/Security Tool Configurations:** Configure your WAF to monitor and block potentially malicious HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames.  Regularly update your security tools and apply necessary patches.

- HTTP Header Injection
- HTTP Parameter Pollution
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (indirectly, if the vulnerable setting triggers a server-side action)

**Note:** This technique's success depends entirely on the specific vulnerabilities in the target application.  It's not a generic attack that can be applied universally.  The examples provided are illustrative and may not directly apply to every web application.  Ethical hacking practices must be followed when testing this.
