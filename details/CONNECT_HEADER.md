# CONNECT_HEADER Bypass Technique

## Overview

The CONNECT_HEADER bypass technique leverages the HTTP CONNECT method, typically used for establishing secure tunnels (e.g., to HTTPS proxies), to potentially bypass security mechanisms that rely solely on inspecting the initial HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST).  By manipulating the HTTP headers within a CONNECT request, an attacker might be able to smuggle malicious data or commands past filters designed to block specific HTTP methods or payload content.  It's often used in conjunction with other techniques to achieve a more complete bypass.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: HTTP Headers Manipulation, HTTP Method Abuse
- **Vulnerability**:  WAF/IDS misconfigurations, insufficient input validation, reliance on simplistic request method filtering.  The vulnerability lies in the lack of robust validation and filtering of data within CONNECT requests.
- **Impact**:  Unauthorized access to resources, data exfiltration, remote code execution (RCE) â€“ depending on the underlying vulnerability being exploited in conjunction with the CONNECT_HEADER bypass.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications with weak input validation, firewalls or intrusion detection systems that primarily filter based on HTTP methods, APIs with insufficient security checks.


## Example

Let's assume a vulnerable web application filters out POST requests containing malicious SQL injection attempts. An attacker could try to bypass this filter by using a CONNECT request and embedding the malicious SQL payload within the headers.  Note that this example requires a vulnerability in the application beyond just the HTTP method filtering.  There must be an existing vulnerability that allows exploitation via the CONNECT header.

```
CONNECT example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
X-Malicious-Header: '; DROP TABLE users;' --
```

The `X-Malicious-Header` (or any other custom header) contains the SQL injection payload. The success depends on how the application processes the CONNECT request and headers.  A vulnerable application might process this header and execute the malicious SQL command.

## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -X CONNECT -H "Host: example.com" -H "X-Attack: <malicious payload>" example.com:80
```

Replace `<malicious payload>` with the actual exploit payload (e.g., SQL injection, XSS script).  This command sends a CONNECT request to `example.com` on port 80, including the malicious payload in a custom header.

### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept a request to the target application.
2. Change the request method to `CONNECT`.
3. Add a custom header with the malicious payload.
4. Forward the modified request.

### Manual Testing

Manual testing is difficult and requires a deep understanding of the target application's behavior and potential vulnerabilities. It involves using the browser's developer tools to craft and send a CONNECT request with modified headers and observing the application's response.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses Security Controls:** This bypasses security controls that rely solely on HTTP method filtering (e.g., blocking POST requests).
- **Potential Risks:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access, application compromise, RCE.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios:** Combining this with other techniques (e.g., HTTP request smuggling) allows attackers to circumvent security measures and inject malicious code or steal sensitive information.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detect this bypass attempt:** Implement robust input validation on all HTTP headers, regardless of the HTTP method used. Monitor logs for unusual CONNECT requests or requests containing unexpected data in headers.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Do not solely rely on HTTP method filtering. Validate and sanitize all user inputs, including headers. Utilize a well-configured WAF with advanced rules to detect and block malicious CONNECT requests.  Apply proper header filtering and sanitization.
- **Secure coding practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and others that could be exploited in conjunction with this bypass technique.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** Configure your WAF to inspect the content of all headers, including those in CONNECT requests.  Use a positive security model, explicitly allowing only expected traffic.
