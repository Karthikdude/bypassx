# ML_EVASION_OLD_BROWSER Bypass Technique

## Overview

This technique exploits machine learning (ML) models used for web application security, specifically those relying on user-agent strings for detection or risk scoring.  It leverages the fact that older, less commonly used browser user-agent strings might be less represented in the ML model's training data, leading to misclassification or a lower risk score.  This allows attackers to evade detection mechanisms that rely on the user-agent string for identifying malicious activity.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: User-Agent Spoofing
- **Vulnerability**: Reliance on outdated or incomplete ML models for security decision-making, insufficient feature engineering in the ML model (over-reliance on user-agent), lack of robust anomaly detection mechanisms.
- **Impact**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass security measures such as intrusion detection systems, web application firewalls (WAFs), and bot mitigation systems, enabling them to inject malicious code, perform data breaches, or launch other attacks.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications that use ML models for security purposes and rely heavily on user-agent strings as a primary feature for risk assessment.  This is especially true for systems that have not updated their ML models recently or those that haven't properly accounted for the diversity of user-agents.


## Example

Let's assume a WAF uses an ML model trained primarily on modern browser user-agent strings.  An attacker could spoof a user-agent string from an older, less common browser like "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061208 Firefox/2.0.0.1" instead of a modern Chrome or Firefox string. The ML model, unfamiliar with this older string, may not correctly classify the request as malicious, allowing the attack to proceed.


## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061208 Firefox/2.0.0.1" "https://target.example.com/vulnerable_page"
```

Replace `"https://target.example.com/vulnerable_page"` with the target URL. This command sends a request with the specified outdated user-agent string.

### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept a request to the target application in Burp Suite.
2. Go to the "Headers" tab.
3. Modify the "User-Agent" header to an older browser user-agent string (e.g.,  "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)".
4. Forward the modified request.
5. Observe if the application's response changes indicating successful bypass.


### Manual Testing

1. Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12).
2. Navigate to the "Network" tab.
3. Modify the User-Agent header in the request before sending it.  Use a User-Agent string from a very old browser.
4. Observe the application's response to see if the change in User-Agent affected the security controls.


## Security Implications

- **Bypass of ML-based security controls:** This bypasses security mechanisms relying solely or heavily on user-agent string analysis within ML models.
- **Increased attack surface:** Attackers can potentially bypass multiple layers of security, increasing the risk of successful exploitation.
- **Data breaches and other attacks:** Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, website defacement, or other malicious activities.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Feature Engineering:**  Don't solely rely on User-Agent strings for ML models. Include other relevant features, such as request characteristics (e.g., payload size, request frequency, parameters).
- **Regular Model Retraining:** Regularly update the ML models with new data, including representations of older browsers and known evasion techniques.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Implement robust anomaly detection mechanisms that can identify unusual patterns regardless of the user-agent string.
- **WAF Rule Updates:**  While not directly addressing the ML aspect, updating WAF rules can provide an additional layer of protection.  However, WAF rules alone are often insufficient against sophisticated bypasses.
- **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs, and don't rely on User-Agent strings for access control.
- **Behavioral analysis:** Incorporate techniques that monitor user behavior and flag suspicious patterns.
