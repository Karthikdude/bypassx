# CACHE Bypass Technique

## Overview

The CACHE bypass technique leverages the caching mechanisms implemented by web servers and CDNs to access sensitive information or bypass security controls.  It exploits the fact that cached responses might contain outdated or unintended data, potentially revealing vulnerabilities or bypassing authorization checks.  This technique doesn't directly target a specific vulnerability in the application code but rather exploits a weakness in how caching is implemented and managed.


## Technical Details

- **Method**:  HTTP Headers Manipulation, URL Manipulation,  Browser Cache Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Improper cache configuration, insufficient cache invalidation, race conditions related to caching, and lack of proper authorization checks within cached responses.
- **Impact**:  Unauthorized access to sensitive data, bypass of authentication/authorization mechanisms, exposure of outdated or insecure application logic, denial of service (DoS) through cache exhaustion in some scenarios.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications using CDNs, reverse proxies (like Nginx or Apache), or any application with aggressive caching strategies.  Applications that don't properly handle cache invalidation after updates are particularly vulnerable.


## Example

Let's assume a web application stores user profiles in a cache.  A user "userA" with limited permissions accesses their profile.  The response is cached.  If the application lacks proper cache invalidation, and "userA" later changes their permissions to "administrator,"  a subsequent access from a different browser or after clearing the browser cache might still serve the cached response, revealing data that "userA" shouldn't access anymore.  Another scenario is that an application displays a user's session token in the response and aggressively caches that response.  An attacker can potentially use that cached session token even if it's supposed to be short-lived.


## How to Test

### Using curl

This example demonstrates a simplified scenario where a cached response reveals sensitive information.  Real-world scenarios are more complex and may require specific HTTP headers or URL manipulations depending on the caching implementation.

```bash
# First request to cache the response
curl -v "https://example.com/profile" -H "Cache-Control: max-age=3600" > response1.txt

# Simulate changing permissions or data

# Second request, hoping to get the cached response
curl -v "https://example.com/profile" > response2.txt

# Compare response1.txt and response2.txt.  If they are identical despite the changes, a cache bypass may be possible.
diff response1.txt response2.txt
```

### Using Burp Suite

1. **Proxy Configuration:** Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy.
2. **Intercept Request:** Intercept the request for a sensitive resource.
3. **Modify Headers:** Manually modify or remove `Cache-Control` or other caching-related headers.  You can also try adding headers to force a fresh response, such as `Pragma: no-cache` or `Cache-Control: no-cache`.
4. **Forward Request:** Forward the modified request and observe the response.  Check if the response is different from the expected behaviour when caching is enabled.
5. **Repeat:** Try different combinations of cache-related headers and URL parameters to see if you can bypass caching.
6. **Analyze Response:** Look for any inconsistencies or signs of cached data being served unexpectedly.


### Manual Testing

1. Access a sensitive resource through your browser.
2. Clear your browser's cache and cookies.
3. Access the same resource again.
4. Compare the responses.  If the second response is identical to the first, despite the cache clearing, a caching issue might exist.  Variations of this involve using different browsers, devices or incognito mode.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses access control:**  This technique bypasses access control measures implemented in the application's logic, if they don't account for caching behavior.
- **Data leakage:** Outdated or sensitive data might be revealed through cached responses.
- **Session hijacking:** Cached responses might contain session tokens that can be exploited by attackers.
- **Denial of service (DoS):** In some cases, the attacker might be able to exhaust cache resources leading to denial of service for legitimate users.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Proper cache invalidation:** Implement robust cache invalidation strategies, ensuring that cached data is updated promptly whenever changes occur.
- **Cache-control headers:** Use appropriate `Cache-Control` headers to control caching behavior effectively. Avoid aggressive caching for sensitive resources.
- **Secure coding practices:**  Ensure that sensitive data isn't accidentally included in cached responses.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** Configure your web application firewall (WAF) to detect and block suspicious cache-related requests or responses.  Some WAFs can monitor cache-related headers and unusual cache behavior patterns.
- **Regular security audits:** Perform regular security assessments and penetration tests to identify potential vulnerabilities related to caching.
- **Least privilege access:**  Minimize the amount of data accessible even in cached responses.  If a response doesn't need specific data, don't include it.
- **Output encoding and escaping:**  Ensure proper encoding to prevent injection attacks that could exploit cache entries.
