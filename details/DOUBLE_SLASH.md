# DOUBLE_SLASH Bypass Technique

## Overview

The DOUBLE_SLASH technique is a URL manipulation bypass method that leverages the way some web applications handle double slashes ("//") in URLs.  It exploits inconsistencies in how these applications normalize or process paths, potentially leading to directory traversal, access to restricted resources, or other vulnerabilities.  Essentially, it inserts extra slashes into the URL path, attempting to either confuse the application's path parsing logic or to directly access unintended files or directories.

## Technical Details

- **Method**: URL Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Primarily exploits weaknesses in input validation and path traversal handling.  Often interacts with vulnerabilities like Path Traversal or insecure file inclusion.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to files or directories, information disclosure, remote code execution (in severe cases), and denial of service (DoS).
- **Common Targets**: Web applications with insufficient input sanitization or path normalization, especially those using legacy or poorly designed file handling functions.


## Example

Let's say a vulnerable web application accesses a user profile using the following URL structure: `/profile?user=username`. A DOUBLE_SLASH bypass attempt might look like this: `/profile?user=username//etc//passwd`.  The `//etc//passwd` part attempts to traverse up directories and access the `/etc/passwd` file (on a Linux/Unix-like system).  The double slashes might be ignored or misinterpreted by a flawed application, allowing access to this sensitive file.

Another example: If a legitimate URL is `/images/profile.jpg`, a DOUBLE_SLASH attack could try `/images//profile.jpg` or even `/images///profile.jpg`.  This might lead to unexpected behavior, possibly revealing internal resources or causing errors which could divulge information.


## How to Test

### Using curl

```bash
curl "http://vulnerable-website.com/profile?user=username//etc//passwd"
```

Replace `"http://vulnerable-website.com/profile?user=username//etc//passwd"` with the actual URL you are testing, adjusting the path according to your target.


### Using Burp Suite

1. **Proxy your traffic:** Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy.
2. **Intercept the request:**  Make a request to the vulnerable application. Intercept the request in Burp Suite's proxy.
3. **Modify the URL:** In the request editor, insert double slashes ("//") into the URL path.  Experiment with different locations and numbers of double slashes.  For instance, add `//` before or after directory separators.
4. **Forward the request:** Forward the modified request.
5. **Analyze the response:** Examine the response for any unusual behavior, error messages, or access to unexpected files or directories.  Success is indicated by access to files or directories normally out of reach.


### Manual Testing

1. **Identify a potential target:** Find a web application that handles user input in URL paths.
2. **Craft the malicious URL:** Add double slashes ("//") to the URL path, similar to the examples above.
3. **Access the URL:**  Visit the modified URL in your browser.
4. **Analyze the results:** Look for unintended access to files, unusual behavior, or error messages revealing sensitive information.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses input validation:**  Many simple input validation checks fail to specifically detect and prevent the use of multiple slashes.
- **Path traversal:** This technique directly facilitates path traversal attacks.
- **Information disclosure:** Access to sensitive files, configuration files, or source code.
- **Remote code execution (RCE):** In conjunction with other vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure file upload), this could enable RCE.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  In some cases, it could lead to application crashes or errors.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Strict input validation:**  Implement robust input validation to filter out extra slashes and unusual path characters.  Use regular expressions or allowlisting of allowed characters.
- **Proper path normalization:**  Ensure the web application properly normalizes file paths, removing redundant slashes and preventing directory traversal.
- **Canonicalization:**  Apply strict canonicalization to URL paths to prevent manipulation.
- **Secure coding practices:**  Avoid using unsafe functions for file handling that don't properly validate or sanitize input.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** Configure your WAF to detect and block requests containing excessive slashes in the URL path or those exhibiting patterns indicative of path traversal.
- **Regular security audits:** Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

  No specific CVE is dedicated solely to the double-slash technique as it's a specific manifestation of a broader vulnerability class.  The impact depends on the application's other vulnerabilities.
