# CSRF_TOKEN_BYPASS Technique

## Overview

This technique focuses on bypassing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms that rely solely on synchronizer tokens (CSRF tokens).  It leverages vulnerabilities in how these tokens are implemented, handled, or stored, to submit malicious requests without a valid, freshly generated token.  This bypass doesn't necessarily involve directly obtaining a legitimate token; instead, it exploits weaknesses in the token's usage or the application's logic surrounding it.


## Technical Details

- **Method**: Primarily HTTP Request Manipulation, potentially involving session manipulation or exploiting predictable token generation.
- **Vulnerability**:  Weaknesses in CSRF token implementation, such as predictable token generation, insufficient token validation, insecure storage of tokens (e.g., in easily accessible parts of the HTML), reuse of tokens across requests or sessions, or lack of proper token expiry mechanisms.  It might also exploit vulnerabilities in how the application handles the tokenâ€™s absence.
- **Impact**: Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a logged-in user, such as account modification, data deletion, financial transactions, or privilege escalation.
- **Common Targets**: Web applications using custom-built CSRF protection mechanisms without sufficient security reviews, or those with poorly implemented token management libraries.  Older applications may be particularly vulnerable.

## Example

Let's assume a vulnerable application uses a CSRF token named `csrf_token` that's predictable or easily guessable.  A malicious website could include a hidden form:

```html
<form action="/critical_action" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="predictable_token_value">
  <input type="hidden" name="action" value="delete_account">
  <script>this.submit();</script>
</form>
```

If the application doesn't adequately validate the `csrf_token` or its generation is flawed (e.g., a simple counter),  this form, when loaded on a victim's browser, will execute the `delete_account` action without their explicit knowledge or consent.


## How to Test

### Using curl

This will depend on the specific vulnerability. If the token is predictable, you might try:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "csrf_token=predictable_token_value&action=delete_account" "http://vulnerable-site.com/critical_action"
```

Replace `"predictable_token_value"` with a guessed or intercepted token value and adapt other parameters as needed.


### Using Burp Suite

1. Intercept a legitimate request containing a CSRF token.
2. Analyze the token's generation and validation mechanism.
3. Try modifying the request by removing the token or substituting it with a guessed or manipulated value.
4. Observe the application's response.  Success suggests a vulnerability.
5.  Use Burp's Repeater to experiment with different token values or variations to find a working bypass.


### Manual Testing

1. Access a legitimate CSRF-protected page and examine its HTML source for the token's value and how it's used.
2. Try to predict the token's generation pattern or find a weakness in its validation.
3. Construct a malicious page with a hidden form containing the modified or guessed token and target action.
4. Access the malicious page while logged in to the target application.


## Security Implications

- **Bypasses:** This bypasses the core security provided by synchronizer tokens, rendering them ineffective.
- **Potential Risks:** Complete compromise of user accounts, data breaches, financial losses, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Real-world Attack Scenarios:**  Phishing emails containing links to malicious websites that exploit these vulnerabilities, compromised websites hosting malicious iframes, or even drive-by attacks.


## Recommendations for Defenders

- **Detection:**  Monitor application logs for suspicious requests with missing or invalid CSRF tokens, or patterns of token reuse. Implement robust request logging and analysis. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with appropriate rules to detect anomalous CSRF token usage.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Use strong, unpredictable token generation methods (cryptographically secure random number generators).  Validate tokens rigorously, checking for existence, freshness, and proper format.  Store tokens securely (not in easily accessible parts of the HTML). Employ double-submit cookie methods in addition to hidden fields. Implement proper token expiry mechanisms. Ensure the application handles missing tokens correctly (e.g., returns an error).
- **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow the OWASP CSRF prevention cheat sheet diligently.
- **WAF/security tool configurations:** Configure WAF rules to detect requests missing CSRF tokens or using potentially manipulated ones.
