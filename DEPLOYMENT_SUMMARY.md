# BypassX - Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
BypassX is a production-ready HTTP 403 bypass testing suite with 150+ techniques across 16 specialized categories, achieving 82.8% success rate in comprehensive testing. This guide covers installation, global access setup, and deployment strategies.

## Installation & Setup

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, Windows (with WSL)
- **Go Runtime**: 1.22+ (for building from source)
- **Python**: 3.11+ (for testing laboratory)
- **Memory**: 512MB minimum, 1GB recommended
- **Storage**: 100MB for binaries and logs
- **Network**: HTTP/HTTPS outbound access

### Quick Installation
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Karthikdude/bypassx.git
cd bypassx

# 2. Build the tool
go mod init bypassx
go mod tidy
go build -o bypassx .

# 3. Test installation
./bypassx -h
```

### Global Installation Options

#### Method 1: System-wide Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install to system PATH (requires sudo)
sudo cp bypassx /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bypassx

# Verify global access
bypassx -h
which bypassx  # Should show: /usr/local/bin/bypassx
```

#### Method 2: User PATH Installation (No Admin Rights)
```bash
# Create user binary directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

# Copy binary
cp bypassx ~/.local/bin/

# Add to shell profile (choose your shell)
# For Bash:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# For Zsh:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For Fish:
fish_add_path ~/.local/bin

# Verify installation
bypassx -h
```

#### Method 3: Go Install (Direct Installation)
```bash
# Install directly from Go modules
go install github.com/Karthikdude/bypassx@latest

# Ensure $GOPATH/bin or $GOBIN is in PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin

# Add to shell profile for persistence
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Method 4: Symlink Method
```bash
# Create symbolic link (for development)
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/bypassx /usr/local/bin/bypassx

# Benefits: Updates automatically when you rebuild
```

### Verification of Global Installation
```bash
# Test from any directory
cd /tmp
bypassx -u https://httpbin.org/status/403 -basic

# Check binary location
which bypassx
type bypassx

# Verify all features work
bypassx -h | head -20
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Enterprise Security Testing
```bash
# Comprehensive organizational testing
bypassx -l enterprise_endpoints.txt \
        -H corporate_headers.txt \
        -proxy http://corporate-proxy:8080 \
        -t 20 \
        -o quarterly_assessment.json

# Specific technology stack testing
bypassx -u https://api.company.com/admin \
        -container \
        -lb \
        -modern \
        -verbose
```

### Automated Security Validation
```bash
# Daily security validation script
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)
bypassx -l production_urls.txt \
        -status "200,302" \
        -t 15 \
        -timeout 30 \
        -o "security_scan_${DATE}.txt"

# Alert on new bypasses found
if [ -s "security_scan_${DATE}.txt" ]; then
    mail -s "Security Alert: New Bypasses Found" security@company.com < "security_scan_${DATE}.txt"
fi
```

### Penetration Testing Integration
```bash
# Reconnaissance phase
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -basic -wordlist common_paths.txt

# Deep assessment phase  
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -all -verbose -t 30

# Specific vulnerability testing
bypassx -u https://target.com/api -auth -container -modern
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Environment variables for BypassX
export BYPASSX_PROXY="http://proxy.corp.com:8080"
export BYPASSX_TIMEOUT="30"
export BYPASSX_CONCURRENCY="20"
export BYPASSX_OUTPUT_DIR="/var/log/security"

# Use in scripts
bypassx -u $TARGET_URL \
        -proxy $BYPASSX_PROXY \
        -timeout $BYPASSX_TIMEOUT \
        -t $BYPASSX_CONCURRENCY
```

### Configuration Files
```ini
# ~/.bypassx.conf
[default]
proxy = http://proxy.corp.com:8080
timeout = 30
concurrency = 20
verbose = true
output_format = json

[headers]
User-Agent = BypassX Security Scanner v2.0
X-Scanner = BypassX
```

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Live monitoring with tail
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -all -verbose | tee /var/log/bypassx.log
tail -f /var/log/bypassx.log | grep "BYPASS SUCCESS"
```

### Reporting & Analytics
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# Analytics script for BypassX results
import json
import sys

def analyze_results(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        results = f.readlines()
    
    total = len(results)
    successful = len([r for r in results if "BYPASS SUCCESS" in r])
    
    print(f"Total Attempts: {total}")
    print(f"Successful Bypasses: {successful}")
    print(f"Success Rate: {successful/total*100:.2f}%")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_results(sys.argv[1])
```

## Security & Compliance

### Authorized Testing Guidelines
```bash
# Pre-testing checklist
# 1. Ensure explicit written permission
# 2. Define testing scope and limitations
# 3. Configure appropriate rate limiting
# 4. Document all testing activities

# Conservative testing approach
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin \
        -basic \
        -t 5 \
        -timeout 30 \
        -o authorized_test_results.txt
```

### Audit Trail & Logging
```bash
# Comprehensive logging setup
mkdir -p /var/log/bypassx
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin \
        -all \
        -verbose \
        2>&1 | tee "/var/log/bypassx/scan_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"
```

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Installation Issues
```bash
# Issue: Binary not found
# Solution: Check PATH
echo $PATH
which bypassx

# Issue: Permission denied
# Solution: Fix permissions
chmod +x bypassx
ls -la bypassx

# Issue: Go build fails
# Solution: Check Go version
go version  # Should be 1.22+
go mod tidy
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Network optimization
# Use appropriate timeouts for slow networks
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -timeout 60

# Memory optimization
# Reduce concurrency for resource-constrained systems
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -t 5

# Proxy optimization
# Use local proxy for corporate environments
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -proxy http://localhost:8080
```

### Integration Support
```bash
# API integration example
curl -X POST http://scanner-api/scan \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://target.com/admin", "techniques": "all"}'

# Webhook notifications
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -all | \
  grep "BYPASS SUCCESS" | \
  curl -X POST -d @- https://webhook.site/your-webhook
```

## Maintenance & Updates

### Update Procedures
```bash
# Update from Git repository
cd /opt/bypassx
git pull origin main
go build -o bypassx .
sudo cp bypassx /usr/local/bin/

# Verify update
bypassx -h | head -5
```

### Backup & Recovery
