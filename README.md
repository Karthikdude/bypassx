```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Test single URL
./bypassx -u https://target.com/admin

# Test with high concurrency
./bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -t 20 -verbose

# Test multiple URLs from file
./bypassx -l urls.txt -o results.txt

# Use proxy
./bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Custom headers
./bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -H headers.txt

# Specific techniques only
./bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -basic
./bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -advanced

# Custom success codes
./bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -status "200,302,401"

# Use wordlist for path fuzzing
./bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -wordlist wordlists/admin_paths.txt
```

## Testing Laboratory

### Start the Lab
```bash
python lab.py
```
Access at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

| `/internal` | IP Filtering | Header pollution, forwarded headers |
| `/debug` | Method Filtering | Verb tunneling, fragments |
| `/waf` | Modern WAF | Cloudflare bypass, cache deception |
| `/cdn` | CDN Protection | Origin IP, cache poisoning |
| `/api/v2/admin` | API Security | JWT bypass, GraphQL, CORS |
| `/microservice` | Service Mesh | Istio/Envoy, Kubernetes, containers |
| `/ml-protected` | ML Detection | Adversarial inputs, timing attacks |

python test_runner.py

# Quick validation test
python quick_test.py
```

## Bypass Techniques

### Basic Techniques (40+)
- HTTP method tampering (HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE)
- X-HTTP-Method-Override headers
- Path obfuscation (trailing chars, encoding, case manipulation)
- Header manipulation (IP spoofing, referer, user-agent)
- Authentication bypass (basic auth, bearer tokens)
- Content-type manipulation
- Host header attacks
- Proxy/CDN bypass techniques

### Advanced Techniques (40+)
- Unicode and confusable characters
- Double URL encoding
- Null path segment injection
- Proxy/load balancer confusion
- Request smuggling simulation
- Header pollution attacks
- File extension spoofing
- Modern WAF evasion (Cloudflare, AWS ALB)
- CDN bypass (origin IP, cache poisoning)
- API security bypass (JWT none algorithm, GraphQL)
- Container escape simulation
- Service mesh bypass (Istio/Envoy)
- ML model evasion techniques

## Architecture

### Go Tool Structure
