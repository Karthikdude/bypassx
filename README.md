## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22+ (required for building the tool)
- Python 3.11+ (required for testing laboratory)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Quick Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bypassx.git
cd bypassx

# Build the tool
go mod init bypassx
go mod tidy
go build -o bypassx .

# Install Python dependencies for testing lab
pip install flask requests

# Test the installation
./bypassx -h
```

### Global Installation (Make BypassX Available System-wide)

#### Option 1: Install to System PATH (Recommended)
```bash
# After building the tool
sudo cp bypassx /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bypassx

# Verify global installation
bypassx -h
```

#### Option 2: Add to User PATH (No sudo required)
```bash
# Create user binary directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

# Copy the binary
cp bypassx ~/.local/bin/

# Add to PATH (add this line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Verify installation
bypassx -h
```

#### Option 3: Using Go Install (Direct from source)
```bash
# Install directly from Go source
go install github.com/yourusername/bypassx@latest

# Verify installation (assuming $GOPATH/bin is in your PATH)
bypassx -h
```

#### Option 4: Create Symlink
```bash
# Create symlink to binary in PATH
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/bypassx /usr/local/bin/bypassx

# Verify installation
bypassx -h
```

### Verify Global Installation
After global installation, you should be able to run BypassX from any directory:
```bash
# Test from any directory
cd /tmp
bypassx -u https://example.com/admin
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

bypassx -l urls.txt -o results.txt

# Use proxy for testing
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Advanced Options

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: This tool is designed for authorized security testing only. Ensure you have explicit permission before testing any systems you do not own.

- Use only on systems you own or have permission to test
- Respect rate limits and avoid DoS conditions
- Follow responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities found
- Consider legal implications in your jurisdiction

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
```bash
# Permission denied
sudo chmod +x bypassx

# Binary not found in PATH
echo $PATH
which bypassx

# Lab not starting
python3 lab.py
pip install flask requests

# Build failures
go version  # Ensure Go 1.22+
go mod tidy
```

### Performance Tuning
```bash
# Adjust concurrency based on target capacity
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -t 5    # Conservative
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -t 50   # Aggressive

# Use appropriate timeouts
bypassx -u https://target.com/admin -timeout 30
```
